# Notes

It's best to start up with the book "Learning the Bash shell" by Cameron Newham and Bill Rosenblatt as it is a great guide for beginners. In this notes, I will be documenting most of my thoughts here so nothing too serious.

If you are a complete beginner or neophyte, you can also pick up bash.

The thing I have noticed is that most programming or scripting language have some basic stuffs: variables(ways to store and manipulate storage), control flows and structures(If conditions, switch, select or anyone amongst this), loops(ways to repeat a task and constantly check for conditions). Some may also include things like customization, Input and output flow(I/o flow). So heres the secret and major motive behind all these things I have been saying. If you want to learn a language very fast, you have got to learn all these concepts as they will enable to do most basic stuffs. You will definitely pick up more concepts through continuous usage of this tool(Programming language in this case). That is like the basis of the 80/20 rule of learning. Learning the 20% of what you will use 80% of the time is not only an effective learning methodology but it helps to keep interest and makes you ahead of the learning curve. Studies show that most people who stop learning stuffs do so because they are basically caught in a learning loop where they don't get to utilize what they are learning and that's where building projects comes in or they meet hard concepts they can't wrap their heads around. Like with most natural human language everyone can speak the basics of their language they use everyday. Bringing that into the tech space also reinforces that knowledge used constantly stick more than those not used(Neuroplasticity). In conclusion, the basis stuffs I listed earlier is what you should look out for when learning new languages because you are going to use these everyday hance they stick more. They also provide basis for other learning concepts. It is called Reinforcement learning. Lately, I have been learning how to learn so follow me for more of these concepts if you want to learn anything fast. Peace üíñüôå‚úåÔ∏è

## How to check Bash version

Checking the bash version is just a simple command to check the bash version and not only that it can also be used to check if bash is availableüòÇ. My guess is it should. check it out here:

```bash
echo $BASH_VERSION
```
