# Tips for Learning Bash successfully

> [!TIP]
> Most programming languages have same structures.
> Go to any bash page and learn this:
> - User defined and system variables
> - Condtionals (just if/else)
> - Functions
> - For loops
> With that, plus the fact that bash searches any command in the current loaded path means you can make magic.
> For example you should be able, today, to query a quotes server every hour and print that quote in the console. This are things to research:
> - Path variable
> - lwp request
> - Cron or just a for loop
> - How to make a program executable
> - How to execute from bashrc
