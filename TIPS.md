# Tips for Learning Bash successfully

## Tip 1

> [!TIP]
> Most programming languages have same structures.
> Go to any bash page and learn this:
> - User defined and system variables
> - Condtionals (just if/else)
> - Functions
> - For loops
> With that, plus the fact that bash searches any command in the current loaded path means you can make magic.
>
> For example you should be able, today, to query a quotes server every hour and print that quote in the console. This are things to research:
> - Path variable
> - lwp request
> - Cron or just a for loop
> - How to make a program executable
> - How to execute from bashrc [By 84nt1m on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/84nt1m/)

## Tip 2

> [!TIP]
> Coursera has a good intro course from IBM on an intro to bash scripting/Linux command line interface. The codeacademy one was great bach when i was learning bash. I took Datacamp courses on Bash scripting and it was a good ride.

## Tip 3

> [!TIP]
> Bash is quirky and has some odd syntax at times. Then there’s confusion about what’s a shell built-in, versus a separate command/software.

> I HIGHLY recommend [shellcheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/), which is a linter with plugins for most editors. You will learn SO MUCH about how to write bash from using this tool. [By Koprulu_Sector](https://www.reddit.com/user/koprulu_sector/)
